Known problems:
- There might be "duplicate" entries when looking up hiragana strings, since the dictionary entry might be the same 
  but the corresponding kanji writings are different. This is also unnecessary duplication in the database.
  The only way of knowing under which kanji writing the entry is added, is currently the title bar.

Possible ideas:
- Support links?
  - Most "suckless" way would probably be to just open a new window with that definition
- "Add this entry"-button before every entry
- Save ankicard as csv if push to ankiconnect failed
- Write a browser addon which enables using dictpopup just by pressing Shift (like yomichan)
- Maybe pass the dictionary over dictionary_data_done() to enable updating the window with a new dictionary
  - I don't think it's necessary though, just open a new window

To check:
- definflector assumes that constant strings given in the code are utf8 encoded. This might be wrong if compiled on Windows for example.

database related:
- Put length of longest entry into the database under LENGTH_OF_LONGEST_ENTRY
