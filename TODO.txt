High priority
- package with autotools

Mid priority
- enable runtime config for the popup window dimensions
- Enable choosing a dictionary sort order
- Skip certain lines
  - しず か （しづ—） [1]【静か・▽閑か】
  -（形動）〔文〕ナリ
- Improve deinflector
  - Expand list of different possible writings in deinflector, e.g.: 齧る -> 噛る, 囓る
  - Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Kanjify the selected word in the sentence according to the dictionary entry

Low priority
- Convert string from locale to UTF-8 and back to locale in unistr (To support other OSes, i.e. Windows)
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until getting some result)
- Add unit tests (for deinflector)
- Add option to display markdown text in the textview
  - A workaround might be passing through lynx

Possible ideas:
- Display small text about which deinflection occured for specific entry (same as yomichan)
- "Add this entry"-button before every entry
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
  - Though I don't think a popup is suitable for this. This should be left to applications such as goldendict


To check:
- definflector assumes that constant strings given in the code are utf8 encoded. This might be wrong if compiled on windows for example.
