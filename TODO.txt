High priority
- Improve second deinflection code (add third?)
  - Best would be some recursive implementation probably and having a variable limiting the depth
- Some way to only add specific dictionary entries
  ! choose selection as entry
  - "Add this entry"-button before every entry
  x choose with dmenu

Mid priority
- enable variable font size
- Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Show notification on success / failure of adding card
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until found)

Low priority
- increase user friendliness
  - error messages if sdcv is missing or if there are no dictionaries available to sdcv
  - Config file instead of compile time config? Impact on startup time has to be tested tho
- Decrease startup time, though 90% of the startup time is probably due to gtk

Ideas:
- Indicator showing if word has been previously added
  - Start searching after showing popup or after button press to avoid slowdown
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
