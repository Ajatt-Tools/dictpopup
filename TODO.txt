High priority
- Improve second deinflection code (add third?)
- Some way to only add specific dictionary entries
  - choose selection as entry
  - "Add this entry"-button before every entry
  - (choose with dmenu)

Mid priority
- Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Show notification on success / failure of adding card
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until found)

Ideas:
- Indicator showing if word has been previously added
  - Start searching after showing popup or after button press
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
