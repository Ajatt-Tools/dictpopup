  -（形動）〔文〕ナリ
- Rewrite deinflector
- Improve deinflector
  - Expand list of different possible writings in deinflector, e.g.: 齧る -> 噛じる, 囓る
  - Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until getting some result)
- If entry has multiple writings (e.g. 脈搏・脈拍) try to pick the one that was scanned

Low priority
- Add unit tests for deinflector
- Display small text about which deinflection occured for specific entry (same as yomichan)
- Enable a configuration for displaying markdown text in the textview
- Show notifications on error

Possible ideas:
- "Add this entry"-button before every entry
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
  - Though I don't think a popup is suitable for this. This should be left to applications such as goldendict


To check:
- definflector assumes that constant strings given in the code are utf8 encoded. This might be wrong if compiled on windows for example.
