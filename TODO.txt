High priority

Mid priority
- display name of dictionary on top
- Change window property to popup
- Expand list of different possible writings in deinflector, e.g.: 齧る -> 噛じる, 囓る
- Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until found)
- If entry has multiple writings (e.g. 脈搏・脈拍) try to pick the one that was scanned

Low priority
- Display small text about which deinflection occured for specific entry (same as yomichan)
- Option to show button bar above or below text
- Enable a switch for displaying markdown text in the textview
- increase user friendliness
  - error messages if sdcv is missing or if there are no dictionaries available to sdcv
  - Config file instead of compile time config?

Possible ideas:
- "Add this entry"-button before every entry
- Indicator showing if word has been previously added
  - Start searching after showing popup or after button press to avoid slowdown
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
  - Though I don't think a popup is suitable for this. This should be left to applications such as goldendict
