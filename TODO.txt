- Some way to only add specific dictionary entries
  - choose selection as entry
  - "Add this entry"-button before every entry
  - (choose with dmenu)
- Improve second deinflection code (add third?)
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until found)
- Maybe also display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
