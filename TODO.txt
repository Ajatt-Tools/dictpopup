High priority
- Some way to only add specific dictionary entries
  ! choose selection as entry
  - "Add this entry"-button before every entry
  x choose with dmenu

Mid priority
- Try to search for different possible writings, eg.: 取りかかる -> 取り掛かる, 齧る -> 噛じる, 囓る
- Try to search for hiragana conversion
- Show notification on success / failure of adding card
- Do yomichan-like lookup (decrease word length from right to left until found)
- If entry has multiple writings (e.g. 脈搏・脈拍) try to pick the one that was scanned
- Try to add the source into Notes field (xdotool?)
- Improve deinflection code

Low priority
- Display small text about which deinflection occured for specific entry
- Option to show button bar above or below text
- Enable a switch for displaying markdown text in the textview
- increase user friendliness
  - error messages if sdcv is missing or if there are no dictionaries available to sdcv
  - Config file instead of compile time config? Impact on startup time has to be tested tho
- Decrease startup time, though 90% of the startup time is probably due to gtk

Ideas:
- Indicator showing if word has been previously added
  - Start searching after showing popup or after button press to avoid slowdown
- Display the full lookup string with clickable characters (yomichan search)
  - Though I don't think a popup is suitable for this. This should be left to applications such as goldendict
