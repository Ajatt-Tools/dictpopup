## dictpopup
- When no entries -> Show "No entries" in definition instead of notification
  - Allows changing settings
- Cache dot indicator result for kanji/reading pairs and lookup for every dict entry
- Disable pronunciation button if nothing found
- Don't show frequency dicts in sort order

Mid priority
- Check if sentence is mapped to some field and only prompt for it in that case
- Write a "Yomichan search"-like window application
- Implement the reading label as a text view to allow for editing -> initiate new search on Enter press
- Group terms by reading, allow for switching between different readings
- Implement a small window to manually enter a search string instead of selecting
- Kanjify the word in the copied sentence according to the dictionary entry
- Remove trailing spaces from user settings
- Need some check when looking up a hiragana conversion from mecab to prevent things like 賢人会 -> 県人会
- Search for audio of inflected selected word (e.g. 下がらない) (optionally)
- Switch to using GSettings
- Write a gui config tool
  - Select dictionaries
  - Choose dictionary sort order
  - build database
  - change general config
- Allow specifying the order for pronunciations
- Cleanup database data on error (lock.mdb)

Low priority
- Better list and table formatting
  - Text only is not enough for that. Would need to surround 
    text with markers and then parse and format at run time
- Right click on audio button -> popup menu with "copy file to clipboard", ...
- Improve "Anki not running" behaviour
  - The circle is currently not shown but still clickable
  - Either ping for Anki or add a reload button
- Support pictures
- Fix "Error obtaining window name" on recursive lookup
  - The problem is, that dictpopup creates a "child window" (?) with id one more which does not have a name
  - This affects all programs which create a child without own title name
- Handle "Anki not running" more gracefully
  - Disable Anki support and reenable automatically if Anki starts
- Allow configurable keybindings
- Allow resizing the window and remember the size on close (write to config.ini)
- Move all Japanese specific things into deinflector.c, choose more language agnostic function names in all other places
- Adds tags to the Anki card, similiar to mpvacious
- Allow canceling context selection with Esc
- Allow changing AnkiConnect API address in config.ini
- Skip certain lines on definition add (without selection), e.g.:
  - しず か （しづ—） [1]【静か・▽閑か】
  -（形動）〔文〕ナリ
- Put length of longest entry into the database under LENGTH_OF_LONGEST_ENTRY. Then limit the lookup by that length
  - Currently hard coded to 60 bytes
  - Only important for an auto scan implementation though

## Known problems:
- Can't pronounce 方方[かたがた]
### Misc
- If there is a dictionary entry for 恭しく even though 恭しい is present in the collection, then a red dot will be shown
### Deinflection
- やった gets deinflected to やつ
  - This can be fixed by reading in the 4th string of a Yomichan term-bank entry, which is:
    "String of space-separated rule identifiers for the definition which is used to validate deinflection.
    An empty string should be used for words which aren't inflected."
- に looks broken

Mecab problems:
- 大正門 pulls 大誓文
- 家名だ

freq:
- いじらしい not present in all

Possible ideas:
- Allow adding audio files indexed by filename (for forvo)
- Add some way to lookup example sentences
  - Maybe something like a menu button which opens a popup menu with: "settings", "lookup massif example sentences", ...
- Implement a dbus service mode
  - Keep window in the background and just hide on close
  - This should allow for near instantaneous lookup (The bottleneck currently is all due to gtk + X11, i.e. starting the window)
- Consider using an Input Method Framework to draw the popup (to allow for mouse pointer positioning for WMs other than X11)
  - Relevant discussion: https://discourse.gnome.org/t/spawning-window-at-mouse-pointer-using-gtk4/19446/6
  - But I think this won't allow moving / resizing the window
  - Another approach might be using an invisible (transparent) fullscreen window with a popover / popup menu at the mouse pointer
  - Need to look into how goldendict's move() function is implemented (Probably using Qt)
- Write a browser addon which enables using dictpopup just by pressing Shift (like yomichan)
  - It simply needs to pass the next ~50 characters starting from the current mouse position as an argument to dictpopup
  - However I strongly doubt that an extension can execute some program, even if it's a local copy
- Display a vertical bar to the right for quickly switching between different dictionaries (similar to goldendict's popup)
- Support hyper links?
  - Could use gtk_label_set_markup, but would need to switch to a label instead of a textview
- Make dictionary numbers (①, ②, ...) clickable for adding to Anki
- A (very small) optimization would be to sort the dictSortOrder string and then use binary search or sth in indexof()

To check:
- definflector.c assumes that constant strings given in the code are utf8 encoded. I don't know if this always has to be true (on Windows)



Test results for storing compressed dictionary entries:
- Snappy: 840M -> 734M
- zstd (without dict, clvl: 10): 840M -> 691M
- zstd (with dict, clvl: 20): 840M -> 544M
