## dictpopup
High priority
- Automatically place config.ini in ~/.config on install

Mid priority
- Implement the reading label as a text view to allow for editing -> initiate new search on Enter press
- Merge dbreader.c and dbwriter.c
- Group terms by reading, allow for switching between different readings
- Implement a small window to manually enter a search string instead of selecting
- Expand deinflection list
- Kanjify the word in the copied sentence according to the dictionary entry
- Remove trailing spaces from user settings
- Write a gui config tool
  - Select dictionaries
  - Choose dictionary sort order
  - build database
  - change general config
- Need some check when looking up a hiragana conversion to prevent things like 賢人会 -> 県人会
- Don't show circle indicator if Anki is not running / on error
- Search for audio of inflected selected word (e.g. 下がらない) (optionally)

Low priority
- Fix "Error obtaining window name" on recursive lookup
  - The problem is, that dictpopup creates a "child window" (?) with id one more which does not have a name
  - This affects all programs which create a child without own title name
- Deinflector should not check for verb stem when some (non 記号 and Japanese) characters where already truncated
- Handle "Anki not running" more gracefully
  - Disable Anki support and reenable automatically if Anki starts
- Allow configurable keybindings
- Allow resizing the window and remember the size on close (write to config.ini)
- Support for pictures
- Move all Japanese specific things into deinflector.c, choose more language agnostic function names in all other places
- Adds tags to the Anki card, similiar to mpvacious
- Allow canceling selecting a sentence with Esc
- Allow changing AnkiConnect API address in config.ini
- Switch dictionary implementation to growable buffers (buf.h)
- Fix Makefile to only rebuild necessary parts
- Don't call jppron through the shell
- Refactor settings.c
- Refactor popup.c
- Add correct feature test macros
- Could split Mecab conversion and kata -> hira conversion into separate configuration options
- Improve portability of non-popup code
- Don't call the shell for jppron
  - merge code into this repo?
- Add command line options for verbosity (esp. showing warnings in dictpopup-create)
- Skip certain lines on definition add (without selection), e.g.:
  - しず か （しづ—） [1]【静か・▽閑か】
  -（形動）〔文〕ナリ
- Add unit tests and do fuzzy testing
- Put length of longest entry into the database under LENGTH_OF_LONGEST_ENTRY. Then limit the lookup by that length
  - Only important for an auto scan implementation though

## dictpopup-create
- Process every dictionary in a different thread?
  - Questionable if this makes sense, as it's already pretty fast and would make the code more complicated

## Known problems:
### Misc
- If there is a dictionary entry for 恭しく even though 恭しい is present in the collection, then a red dot will be shown
### Deinflection
- 与ろうとする missing
- やった gets deinflected to やつ
  - This can be fixed by reading in the 4th string of a Yomichan term-bank entry, which is:
    "String of space-separated rule identifiers for the definition which is used to validate deinflection.
    An empty string should be used for words which aren't inflected."
- たいそう gets deinflected to たいい
- 白けた gets deinflected to 白い
- 目した only gets deinflected to 目す
- はたきながら (should become はたく)
- 挿げ(変わる)
- に looks broken
- 大正門 pulls 大誓文
- Can't definlect 眠ろうとする, 粘ろうとする

Possible ideas:
- loading percentage in dictpopup-create
- A (very small) optimization would be to sort the dictSortOrder string and then use binary search or sth in indexof()
- Right click on audio button -> open some menu with "copy file to clipboard", ...
- Consider using an Input Method Framework to draw the popup (to allow mouse pointer positioning for WMs other than X11)
  - Relevant discussion: https://discourse.gnome.org/t/spawning-window-at-mouse-pointer-using-gtk4/19446/6
  - But I think this won't allow moving / resizing the window
  - Another approach might be using an invisible (transparent) fullscreen window with a popover / popup menu at the mouse pointer
  - Need to look into how goldendict's move() function is implemented (Probably using Qt)
- Write a browser addon which enables using dictpopup just by pressing Shift (like yomichan)
  - It simply needs to pass the next 50 characters starting from the current mouse position as an argument to dictpopup
  - However I strongly doubt that an extension can execute some program, even if it's a local copy
- Display a vertical bar to the right for quickly switching between different dictionaries (similar to goldendict's popup)
- Support hyper links?
  - Could use gtk_label_set_markup, but would need to switch to a label instead of a textview
- Make dictionary numbers (①, ②, ...) clickable for adding to Anki
- Implement a dbus service mode
  - Keep window in the background and just hide on close

To check:
- definflector.c assumes that constant strings given in the code are utf8 encoded. I don't know if this always has to be true (on Windows)

Test results for storing compressed dictionary entries:
- Snappy: 840M -> 734M
- zstd (without dict, clvl: 10): 840M -> 691M
- zstd (with dict, clvl: 20): 840M -> 544M
